# Introduction to Dynamsoft Code Parser

When working with IDs, driver licenses, or sometimes even general barcodes, you may encounter results (usually as a plain string) that are "unreadable" but contain all the useful information you need. Dynamsoft Code Parser (DCP) is an SDK designed for parsing these types of results into human-readable information.

## Supported Code Types

* Machine Readable Travel Documents

All versions of Machine Readable Travel Documents (MRTD) specified by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) are supported.

For further details, take a look at [Machine Readable Travel Documents introduction]({{site.code_types}}mrtd.html).

* North America driver's license

Countries covered: USA, Canada.

All versions of the AAMVA Driver's License/Identification Specification used in the US and Canada are supported.

For further details, take a look at [North America DL/ID introduction]({{site.code_types}}aamva-dl-id.html).

* South African driver's license

The fields parsed from the South African driver's license are currently limited to some personal information, while the full information will be parsed in a future release.

For further details, take a look at [South Africa Driver License introduction]({{site.code_types}}za-dl.html).

* Aadhaar Card in India

The normal QR codes or Secure QR codes on eAadhaar, Aadhaar Letter and Aadhaar PVC Card are all capable to be parsed.

For further details, take a look at [Aadhaar introduction]({{site.code_types}}aadhaar.html).

* Vehicle Identification Number

The Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) following ISO 3779 and standard used in North America and European Union.

For further details, take a look at [VIN introduction]({{site.code_types}}vin.html).
